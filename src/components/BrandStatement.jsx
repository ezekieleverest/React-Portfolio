    <h2>Hello, my name is Zeke Everest</h2>
    <p>     I am a Full-stack web developer based in St. Cloud, MN,  with a background in psychology using my experience and education to understand the needs presented. I recently earned a certificate in full-stack development with the University of Minnesota, where I gained proficiency in Mongo, Express, React, Node.js, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I am also confident in web responsiveness design with experience in remote development. Able to flow around a problem to see it from multiple angles and create solutions to fit the situation. Passionate about providing users with an application that fits exactly what they need and is easy to use. With my most recent project, my team and I seamlessly collaborated to produce an application that allows users to create, view, and store a character for later use in a Dungeons and Dragons setting. I am a strong collaborator and team player, and I strive to provide intuitive and powerful applications that can streamline the development and production process.
